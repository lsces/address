It is intended that this package will handle a range of postcode data
files which are provided free by the relevant country or postal authority.

The initial target is the UK postcode table, but the overlying structure 
of the country and zone tables from the commerce package are also integrated, 
and these will be also be moved to .csv listings in this directory to simplify 
management of the data. 

This is an alternative to the nlpg package for customers who do not have access 
to local authority llpg data sets. It is planned that these will interleave 
information if both area available. 

Testing the linked pushing of versions.
